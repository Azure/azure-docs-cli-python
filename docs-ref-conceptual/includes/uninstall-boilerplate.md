If you ever decide to uninstall the Azure CLI, we're sorry to see you go. Before you uninstall, use the `az feedback` command to give
some reasons why you chose to uninstall and how the CLI could be improved. We want to make sure that the Azure
CLI is as bug-free and user-friendly as possible. You can also [file a github issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).
